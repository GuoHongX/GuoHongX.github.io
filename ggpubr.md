ggpubr: ‘ggplot2’ Based Publication Ready Plots
ggplot2, by Hadley Wickham, is an excellent and flexible package for elegant data visualization in R. However the default generated plots requires some formatting before we can send them for publication. Furthermore, to customize a ggplot, the syntax is opaque and this raises the level of difficulty for researchers with no advanced R programming skills.

The ‘ggpubr’ package provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing ‘ggplot2’- based publication ready plots.
